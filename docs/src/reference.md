# Fixation rates
The expected fixation rate are defined as the sum of the fixation rates by categories, including strong and weakly positive fixation probabilites:  $\mathbb{E}\left[D\right] = LT\left(\mathbb{E}\left[D_{n+}\right] + \mathbb{E}\left[D_{n-}\right] + \mathbb{E}\left[D_{s}\right]\right)$. Each expected value is descomposed by one o more functions.
