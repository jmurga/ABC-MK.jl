# Analytical estimation
### Solving $\alpha_{(x)}$
Our method is based in the analytical solution of $\alpha_{(x)}$ given a genetic scenario. The method could be extended to any *DFE* and background selection values in order to get summary statistics that can be used as prior distrubtions at *ABC* methods. In this example we show how asympotic $\alpha$ is affected by linkage and background selection.

*adap* is the only variable exported from *Analytical* module. It is a Mutable structure contaning the variables required to solve the analytical approach. Any value can be easly changed. Remember *adap* should be change before the execution, in other case, $\alpha_{(x)}$ will be solve with the default values. To change all the values at once, you can use [`Analytical.changeParameters`](@ref) in order to set specific models. Please take into account some package used here could be changed. 

Load the modules
```julia
using Analytical, Plots
```

Set the model parameters
```julia
Analytical.changeParameters(gam_neg=-83,
                            gL=10,
                            gH=500,
                            alLow=0.2,
                            alTot=0.2,
                            theta_f=1e-3,
                            theta_mid_neutral=1e-3,
                            al=0.184,
                            be=0.000402,
                            B=0.999,
                            bRange=append!(collect(0.2:0.05:0.95),
                            0.999),
                            pposL=0.001,
                            pposH=0.0,
                            N=500,
                            n=25,
                            Lf=10^6,
                            rho=0.001,
                            TE=5.0,
                            convoluteBinomial=true
                        )
```

Solving the model. Here we solve $\alpha$ generally using the expected rates. We are not considering any especific mutation process over a locus and branch time.

```julia
Analytical.set_theta_f()
theta_f = adap.theta_f
adap.B = 0.999
Analytical.set_theta_f()
Analytical.setPpos()
adap.theta_f = theta_f
adap.B= B

x,y = Analytical.analyticalAlpha(gammaL=adap.gL,gammaH=adap.H,pposL=adap.pposL,pposH=adap.pposH)
```

Plotting the results. $x$ contains $\alpha_{(x)}$ accounting for weakly beneficial alleles. $y$ contains the true value of $\alpha_{(x)}$, not accounting for weakly beneficial alleles.

```julia
Plots.PlotMeasures
Plots.gr()
Plots.theme(:bright)

Plots.plot(collect(1:size(x,1)),hcat(x,y),
    legend = :bottomright,
    seriestype = :line,
    xlabel = "Derived Alleles Counts",
    ylabel = "Î±",
    label = ["All alleles" "Neutral + deleterious"],
    markershapes= [:circle :circle],
    lw = 1,
    xscale = :log,
    fmt = :svg,
    bottom_margin=10 * Plots.PlotMeasures.mm,
    left_margin=10 * Plots.PlotMeasures.mm,
    size=(700,500)
)
```
